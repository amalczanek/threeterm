# threeterm

Three.JS WebGL terminal emulator that can be easily added to your three.js
application. To use it, call terminal.create() with the parameters you want
to use for your size and row/col count.

#Status

Currently, it is in its very beginning stages. It doesn't handle control chraacters
correctly, the chraracter map is non-standard, and it has several bugs. There are 
plenty of things on the to do list, but I'm building this mostly for my privte use,
so I won't be addressing things in any order necessarily. That said, if you have
feedback you can contact me and I would be glad to look into adding things or fixing
bugs, or accepting patches should you fix anything yourself.
